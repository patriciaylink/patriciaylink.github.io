# Real-time Bus Tracker 
This creates a web page animation that displays a map which will track the active buses on the MBTA Route 1 in real-time.

# Description
In this exercise, we use Google Maps to create a real-time tracker of buses on the MBTA Route 1 that travel from Harvard to Nubian Station.  We have connected to the MBTA's API to pull down bus location (latitude & longitude) in real-time. It is pulling data from the API every 15 seconds.  The location of each bus is shown on the map. Red buses are moving in the direction from south (Nubian Square) to north (Harvard).  Blue buses are moving from north to south.

# Installation
This activity requires the JavaScript (mapanimation.js) file to connect to the MBTA API.  The index.html file is needed to display the map.  Two images (red.png and blue.png) are needed as markers for the buses.  The CSS (styles.css) file can also be used in this exercise.

# Usage
This exercises showcases what is possible when connecting to an API and using real-time data for tracking.

# Roadmap
There could be a button added to start tracking, instead of automatically on page load.  The map colors could also be muted (grayscale) so that the bus markers are more easily visible.  This could also be expanded to include other bus routes, and/or give users a way to select their bus route of interest.
