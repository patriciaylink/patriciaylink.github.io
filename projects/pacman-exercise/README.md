# PacMan Factory
This creates a new PacMan at a random position with each button click.  When the game is started, the PacMan will move around the page at a random velocity.

# Description
In this exercise, clicking on the 'Add PacMan' button will make a new PacMan and place it at a random position on the page. When the game is started, the PacMan or PacMen will start moving around the page at a random velocity. When it hits the edge of the page (vertical or horizontal), it will bounce off the walls and change direction.

# Installation
To see a PacMan successfully moving horizontally and vertically within the web page, the four different images of PacMan will also be needed: Pacman1, Pacman2, Pacman3, and Pacman4. The images are of PacMan with mouth open & mouth closed, facing left and facing right. In addition to the images, index.html and pacmen.js are also needed.

# Usage
This exercise showcases that each PacMan has its own position & velocity that needs to be tracked in the code. For each PacMan, the code also needs to account for the right direction of travel and correct image to use (mouth open/mouth closed.)
